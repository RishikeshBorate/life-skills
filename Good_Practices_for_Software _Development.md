# Good Practices for Software Development

## Question 1 
### Which point(s) were new to you?
The insight about the importance of over-communicating in group channels rather than relying on private DMs was both new and valuable. It emphasizes how maintaining visibility ensures the entire team stays aligned and reduces the chances of missing critical updates. Furthermore, the suggestion to join meetings a few minutes early to build rapport with teammates was an interesting idea I hadn't considered before.

## Question 2 
### Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
I need to work on managing distractions and staying fully engaged during work hours, as social media and notifications often disrupt my focus. To address this:
- I will use tools like Freedom or TimeLimit to block distracting apps during work hours.
- I will keep my phone on silent, enabling notifications only for work-related apps.
- I will create a strict schedule with dedicated time for deep work, ensuring I focus on one task at a time and avoid multitasking.
Additionally, Iâ€™ll prioritize balanced meals and incorporate daily exercise to maintain consistent energy levels throughout the day.
