## Tiny Habits

### Question 1
### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting story was, after consistently stepping on a weighing machine that sends weight tweets automatically, he saw the need to lose weight and after developing some tiny habits he was able to lose weight.
In the short term, it didn't show any progress, but we can see a difference in the long term.

### Question 2
### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
**B:** The behaviour you want to form.
**MAP:** The factors influencing whether you'll do it:

M is Motivation. How much do you want to do it.
A is Ability. How easy it is to do it.
P is Prompt: What reminds you to do it.

To make a habit stick:
- Start small).
- Find motivation.
- Set a reminder.

### Question 3
### Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
Celebrating "Shining" is important because:
- It creates a positive association with the habit, making it more enjoyable to repeat.
- Celebrating successes helps maintain motivation and keeps you on track.
- Celebrating reinforces the behaviour, increasing the likelihood of it becoming a habit.
- Each small win can build momentum, facilitating continued engagement with the habit.

### Question 4
### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most fascinating concept was emphasising small, consistent improvements (1% better every day). Over time, these tiny changes compound to create significant transformation, showing the power of consistency and gradual progress.
This idea underscores how focusing on manageable, incremental steps can lead to remarkable achievements without feeling overwhelming.

### Question 5
### What is the book's perspective about Identity?
The book argues that your habits shape your identity. What you do consistently defines who you are. For example, regularly exercising may lead you to identify as an athlete.

### Question 6
### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
Make habits easier by removing barriers. Set up your space so the habit is simple to do, like laying out your workout clothes the night before.

### Question 7
### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
To break bad habits, the book suggests doing the opposite of building good ones:
- Avoid or hide the things that trigger the habit.
- Focus on the downsides of the habit.
- Add obstacles to make the habit harder to do.
- Take away the reward or make it less enjoyable.

### Question 8:
### Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
- Place workout clothes where you see them first thing in the morning.
- Choose enjoyable activities like dancing or hiking to make exercise more exciting.
- Reward yourself with a treat or relaxation after completing a workout.

### Question 9:
### Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
- Remove distractions from your workspace, such as your phone or tablet. Set specific times for screen use.
- Associate screen time with negative consequences, such as eye strain or headaches.
- Make it inconvenient to use screens by putting devices in a separate room or using website blockers.
- Find alternative activities that are more rewarding, such as reading, spending time in nature, or engaging in hobbies.
