# Scaling 
In the context of software development, scalability is an applicationâ€™s ability to handle workload variation while adding or removing users with minimal costs. So, a scalable solution is expected to remain stable and maintain its performance after a steep workload increase, whether expected or spontaneous. Examples of increased workload are:
- Many users accessing the system simultaneously
- Expansion in storage capacity requirements
- Increased number of transactions being processed
